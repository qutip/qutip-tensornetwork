class FiniteTT(Network):
    """Represent finite tensor-trains. This can be either MPS or MPO. A
    schematic representation of such tensor trains are:
        |   |   |
        * - * - *
        |   |   |
    where "-" represents an edge and "*" a node. The above graph represents an
    MPO but MPS can also be represented with this class. The dangling edges
    represent the ``in_edges`` and ``out_edges`` (which correspond to rows and
    columns of a matrix when the network is contracted into a 2D array). The
    bonds connecting the nodes can be accessed with ``bond_edges``. Nodes can
    also be accessed in a shorted list format using ``node_list``.

    Notes
    -----
    Nodes in this class have been named from 0 to L, with L the number of
    nodes, as they can be sorted (from left to right). The axes of each node
    have also been named for easy access. These are named as: {"in", "out",
    "rbond", "lbond"}.

    Parameters
    ----------
    out_edges: List of Edges
        The edges of the network to be used as the output edges.

    in_edges: List of Edges
        The edges of the network to be used as the input edges.

    nodes: None or List of Nodes
        Nodes of the network. If None, the nodes are obtained
        by finding all the nodes that belong to the graphs that include
        ``in_edges`` and ``out_edges``.

    copy: bool, default True
        Whether to copy all the ``Nodes``/``Edges`` involved in the
        network. At this moment a copy is always returned.

    Attributes
    ----------
    nodes : set of Nodes
        Nodes that belong to the Network. These can either be reachable from
        in_edges and out_edges or scalar nodes, in which case they have no
        edges.

    train_nodes: List of Nodes
        Nodes of the tensor-train sorted from left to right.
    out_edges : list of Edges
        List of ``Edges`` to be used. When the network is considered as a
        matrix, these edges represent the rows.

    in_edges : list of Edges
        List of ``Edges`` to be used. When the network is considered as a
        matrix, these edges represent the columns.

    bond_edges: List of Edges
        The edges between the nodes of the tensor-train. These are sorted from
        left to right (i.e. ``train_nodes[i]["rbond"] == bond_edges[i]``).

    dims : list of int
        Dimension of the system as a list of lists. dims[0] represents the
        out dimensions whereas dims[1] represents the in dimension.

    shape : tuple of int
        Shape that the matrix would have if the network is represented with a
        matrix.

        node may be larger than ``max_truncation_err[i]`` if required to
        satisfy ``bond_dimension[i]``.

        Notes
        -----
        The truncation method consists of performing an SVD decomposition from
        left to right and truncating each node's list of singular values as
        specified (see the parameter descriptions below). Note that singular
        values of i-th node are contracted to the i-th node. This means that
        the result is _not_ in a canonical form.

        Parameters
        ----------
        bond_dimension: List of int or int
            List of integers that define, from left to right, the target bond
            dimension. If a single integer is provided is understood as the
            same bond dimension for all bonds. ``None`` is understood as
            "infinite" bond dimension and hence is ignored.

        max_truncation_err: List of float or float
            Maximum truncation error for each individual node. If a single
            value is provided instead of a list, it is the assumed that the
            same value applies for every node. ``None`` is understood as 0 and
            hence it is ignored. If both ``bond_dimension`` and
            ``max_truncation_err`` are provided, ``bond_dimension`` takes
            precedence.

        Returns
        -------
        truncated_values: float
            List of lists with the truncated singular values.
            truncated_values[i] contains the truncated singular values for the
            i-th node.
