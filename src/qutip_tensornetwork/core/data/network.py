class Network(qutip.core.data.Data):
    """Represents arbitrary quantum objects as tensor networks.

    Tensor networks will be composed of ``tensornetwork.Nodes`` and
    ``tensornetwork.Edges``. Nodes represent n-dimensional arrays whose
    dimensions are connected with edges to other arrays. An edge represents the
    contraction that needs to be carried out between two nodes. The contraction
    of nodes is done in a `lazy` way, which means that is only carried out when
    necessary or explicitly requested with the contract method.

    Edges can be either dangling (one of its ends is not connected to any node)
    or fully connected. To represents arbitrary quantum objects, we employ the
    dangling edges ``out_edges`` and ``in_edges``. Considered as a matrix, the
    dangling ``out_edges`` and ``in_edges`` represent the rows and columns of
    the matrix respectively.

    Parameters
    ----------
    out_edges: List of Edges
        The edges of the network to be used as the output edges.

    in_edges: List of Edges
        The edges of the network to be used as the input edges.

    nodes: None or List of Nodes
        Nodes of the network. If None, the nodes are obtained
        by finding all the nodes that belong to the graphs that include
        ``in_edges`` and ``out_edges``.

    copy: bool, default True
        Whether to copy all the ``Nodes``/``Edges`` involved in the
        network.

    Attributes
    ----------
    nodes : set of Nodes
        Nodes that belong to the Network. These can either be reachable from
        in_edges and out_edges or scalar nodes, in which case they have no
        edges.

    out_edges : list of Edges
        List of ``Edges`` to be used. When the network is considered as a
        matrix, these edges represent the rows.

    in_edges : list of Edges
        List of ``Edges`` to be used. When the network is considered as a
        matrix, these edges represent the columns.

    dims : list of int
        Dimension of the system as a list of lists. dims[0] represents the
        out dimensions whereas dims[1] represents the in dimension.

    shape : tuple of int
        Shape that the matrix would have if the network is represented with a
        matrix.

    Notes
    -----
    Most of the operations and logic of this class has been derived from
    ``tensornetwork.quantum.QuOperator`` and adapted for our use.
